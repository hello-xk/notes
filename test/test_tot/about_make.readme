1, auto make
    make XXX    =>   cc XXX.c -o XXX
    so, if there is a C source file named as tot.c then use "make tot" can auto
compile the tot.c file.
    This is usable in GNU Make 3.81

2, auto make with gcc 
    CC=gcc make XXX   =>  gcc XXX.c -o XXX
    CC=gcc; make XXX  =>  cc XXX.c -o XXX   (so without';')

3, use this characteristic to wirte a makefile

CC = gcc
all:
    find ./ -name "*.c" | sed "s/.c//" | xargs make 
clean:
	find ./ -name "*.c" | sed "s/.c//" | xargs rm

This makefile would auto compile the C source files of current folder
